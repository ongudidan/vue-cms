# Installing Vue Multiselect

Since the terminal has issues, please manually install the package:

```bash
npm install @vueform/multiselect@^2.6.0
```

This package provides a beautiful, searchable multi-select component that works perfectly with Vue 3.

After installation, the MenuModal.vue has been updated to use this component for the pages selection.
